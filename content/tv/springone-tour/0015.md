### Workshop

##### April 28 &bullet; 9:00&ndash;13:30 GMT

We’ll kick off SpringOne Tour Booternetes Europe with a quick look at Kubernetes. We’ll cover the basic Kubernetes concepts you’ll need for the workshop, such as pods, deployments, and load balancing.

Then get ready to put your Kubernetes knowledge to practice in a hands-on workshop. We’ll cover tools and best practices for getting your Spring apps to Kubernetes quickly and easily. We’ll start at everyone’s (second) favorite place on the internet, start.spring.io, and walk through the process of creating new apps all the way through to automated deployments directly to Kubernetes. By the end of this session, you’ll have all the knowledge you need to target Kubernetes as your production environment.

Registration and speaker details coming soon.
